# ScreenCalculator

## Purpose

This is a simple demo to test AngularJS with RequireJS, without Angular being in the global scope and without the use of build functions.

## Outlook

I've prepared the structure so that it is TypeScript ready. In the next step I will convert it to TypeScript and then add Unit Test support.
